I wrote this repo to illustrate my question.

Does AVA execute ALL assertions even if one of those assertions already failed?

        1 passed
        2 exceptions


        1. Uncaught Exception
        TypeError: Cannot read property 'data' of undefined
          Timeout._onTimeout (index.test.js:34:10)

        âœ– Test results were not received from index.test.js
    npm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.
